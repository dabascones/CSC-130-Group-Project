# CSC-130-Group-Project
Group Project for CSC-130 2021

GROUP PROJECT
OBJECTIVES

- Develop a deep understanding on one or more topics in data structures
- Learn how to work in a group
INSTRUCTION

Our department requires every course to have a group project. There are two goals. First, students will develop a deeper understanding on topics that interest them. Second, students will also learn how to work in a group, which is something essential in the software industry.

Your task is to create a Python application that uses at least one data structure introduced in this course. Please follow these steps:

1.	You will form a group of 3 to 4 students. I will provide the name and email address of every student in the class. If you donâ€™t form a group yourself, I will assign you to a group.
2.	Discuss with your group members and come up with a topic.
3.	Design, code and test your program.
4.	Make a class presentation. Each group will have 5 to 10 minutes to do the following:
a.	Give a brief description of your project
b.	Demonstrate your application
c.	Tell the class what you have learned in this experience
5.	Submit your project code
6.	Submit a one to two page description of your project, including what your program is designed to do and what data structures you use.
